# WebXR Multiuser Environment

The project showcases the University of Prishtina in the immersive world of Virtual Reality. It supports multiuser environment to make the interaction more fun. You can watch the other users as spheric avatars with big eyes, but don't stare at them for too long! 

## Technologies
This application uses [**A-Frame**](https://aframe.io/), a web framework for building 3D/AR/VR experiences built on top of Three.js specifically for WebXR. The server that handles the directional data is built with [**Express.js**](https://expressjs.com/), [**Open-EasyRTC**](https://github.com/open-easyrtc/open-easyrtc) and [**Networked-AFrame**](https://github.com/networked-aframe).
